    This file belongs to the private repository "master_thesis" where
    I save all the files that are related to my thesis which is called
    "Método para la segmentación de imágenes de resonancia magnética 
    cerebrales usando una arquitectura de red neuronal basada en modelos
    de atención".

Description: The data that I am using for this repository is based on
the Mindboggle-101 Data (https://mindboggle.info/data.html) and I 
downloaded the files from https://osf.io/yhkde/. The paper for this 
dataset is located in the folder "papers" from this repository and it 
is called as "101 labeled brain images and a consistent human corticallabeling protocol".

After that, I took each individual from the FreeSurfer_output and extracted 
the following files:
    - 001.mgz
    - aparcNMMjt+aseg.mgz

These two represent the brain scan without any modification and the brain scan 
with the parcellation.

The file 'common_anatomical_structures.txt' contains the information of all the anatomical
structures that are common in all 101 MRIs that are divided in the following folders:
